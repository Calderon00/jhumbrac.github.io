        <h2>What are 1:1 sessions and how do I book them?</h2>
        <p>1:1 Sessions are weekly 30-minute meetings with a mentor where you’ll receive help and get feedback on your projects.  These 1:1 sessions are critical to your success in the course, so please meet with us regularly - even if you don’t think you need any help one week!  We will be able to provide feedback on your projects and correct errors that you may not even recognize as errors.  We also host open Office Hours regularly throughout the week as an additional way to get help from your mentors.</p>
        <p>For general mentor support outside of 1:1 sessions, please email <a href="mailto:circuits-mentor@generalassemb.ly" target="_blank">circuits-mentor@generalassemb.ly</a></p>
        <h3>In order to help you resolve your problem quickly without alot of back and forth, please follow the below guidelines for email communication with your mentors.</h3>
